# React_Todo_List_App
## Description

In this project, IÂ´ve build a ToDo App list on React. The list already shows some To Dos. New To Dos can be added in the "Add Todo" field. To Dos can be deleted, just by clicking on them. 
The file [index.js](https://github.com/Soniajim24/React_Todo_List_App/blob/main/index.js) contains most of the code, including:
- The App component
- The initial state of the App with 3 To Dos, which have been initialized, and a description. 

The file [index.html](https://github.com/Soniajim24/React_Todo_List_App/blob/main/index.html) contains a boilerplate for a React application, with minor changes.

The [styles.css](https://github.com/Soniajim24/React_Todo_List_App/blob/main/styles.css) contains the styles used for the App.

## How to run it
Start your server at port 8080 and load the App into the browser.
- Add new To Dos by entering text in the "Add Todo" field.
- Delete To Dos by clicking on them.
